.TH XWAX "1"

.SH NAME
xwax \- Digital vinyl on Linux (s-xwax fork)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwax
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
xwax is vinyl emulation software for Linux. It allows DJs and
turntablists to playback digital audio files (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC,
AAC and more), controlled using a normal pair of turntables via
timecoded vinyls.

The s-xwax (Super-Xwax) fork changes to vertical stacked waveforms
and adds popular user mods like deck protection and played tracks list.

.SH OPTIONS

.P
The ordering of options is important; many options apply to to
subsequent music libraries or decks, which can be given multiple times.
See the
.B EXAMPLES
below.

.TP
.B \-l \fIpath\fR
Scan the music library at the given path.
Also scans .xspf and .pls playlists (s-xwax only).

.TP
.B \-p \fIpath\fR
Load a 'playlist' at the given path. This operation is identical to
scanning a music library except that the order is retained.
Also scans .xspf and .pls playlists (s-xwax only).

.TP
.B \-t \fIname\fR
Use the named timecode for subsequent decks. See \-h for a list of
valid timecodes. You will need the corresponding timecode signal on
vinyl to control playback.

.TP
.B \-33
Set the reference playback speed for subsequent decks to 33 and one
third revolutions per minute. This is the default.

.TP
.B \-45
Set the reference playback speed for subsequent decks to 45
revolutions per minute.

.TP
.B \-i \fIpath\fR
Use the given importer executable for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-s \fIpath\fR
Use the given scanner executable to scan subsequent music libraries.

.TP
.B \-h
Display the help message and default values.

.SH ALSA DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
ALSA support.

.TP
.B \-a \fIdevice\fR
Create a deck which uses the given ALSA device (eg. plughw:0).

.TP
.B \-r \fIhz\fR
Set the sample rate for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-m \fImilliseconds\fR
Set the ALSA buffer time for subsequent decks.

.SH JACK DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
JACK support.

.TP
.B \-j \fIname\fR
Create a deck which connects to JACK and registers under the given
name.

.P
xwax does not set the sample rate for JACK devices; it uses the sample
rate given in the global JACK configuration.

.SH OSS DEVICE OPTIONS

.P
The following options are available only when xwax is compiled with
OSS support.

.TP
.B \-d \fIpathname\fR
Create a deck which uses the given OSS device (eg. /dev/dsp).

.TP
.B \-r \fIhz\fR
Set the sample rate for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-b \fIn\fR
Set the number of OSS buffers for subsequent decks.

.TP
.B \-f \fIn\fR
Set the OSS buffer size (2^n bytes).

.SH CONTROLS

.P
The playback of each deck (direction, speed and position) is
controlled via the incoming timecode signal from the turntables.
The keyboard provides additional controls.

.P
Record selection controls:

.TP
cursor up, cursor down
Move highlighted record up/down by one.

.TP
page up, page down
Scroll the record listing up/down by one page.

.TP
left cursor, right cursor
Switch to the previous/next crate of records.

.TP
tab
Toggle between the current crate and the 'All records' crate.

.P
To filter the current list of records type a portion of a record
name. Separate multiple searches with a space, and use backspace to
delete.

.P
Deck-specific controls:

.TS
l l l l.
Deck 0	Deck 1	Deck 2
F1	F5	F9	Load currently selected track to this deck
F2	F6	F10	Reset start of track to the current position
F3	F7	F11	Toggle timecode control on/off
.TE

Audio display controls:

.TP
+, \-
Zoom in/out the close-up audio meters for all decks.

.SH EXAMPLES

.P
2-deck setup using one directory of music and OSS devices:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-d /dev/dsp \-d /dev/dsp1
.RE

.P
As above, but using ALSA devices:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-d hw:0 \-d hw:1
.RE

.P
2-deck setup using a different timecode on each deck:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-t serato_2a \-d hw:0 \-t mixvibes_v2 \-d hw:1
.RE

.P
As above, but with the second deck at 45 RPM:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-t serato_2a \-d hw:0 \-t mixvibes_v2 \-45 \-d hw:1
.RE

.P
3-deck setup with the third deck at a higher sample rate:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-r 48000 \-a hw:0 \-a hw:1 \-r 96000 \-a hw:2
.RE

.P
Using all three device types simultaneously, one deck on each:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-a hw:0 \-d /dev/dsp1 \-j jack0
.RE

.P
Scan multiple music libraries:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-l ~/sounds \-l ~/mixes \-a hw:0
.RE

.P
Scan a second music library using a custom script:
.sp
.RS
xwax \-l ~/music \-i ./custom-scan \-l ~/sounds \-a hw:0
.RE
